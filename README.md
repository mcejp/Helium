# Helium Programming Language

A bit of etymology:

- A *list* of *items*: `(1, 2, 3)`
- An *object* has *members* (probably should be *properties*, *attributes*, *fields*, or something)
- All *functions* go into *modules* (previously: units), including the fictitious *main function*

TODO:

- how to build
- some examples of usage
- strings mutable or not?
- all compile-time options
